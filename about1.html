    <h2>About Hunting</h2>
    <p>Hunting plays an important role in wildlife management and conservation. Hunters often contribute to environmental protection efforts through licenses and fees.Hunting is the practice of tracking and killing wild animals, often for food, sport, or population control. It requires skill, patience, and knowledge of animal behavior and the environment. Hunters use tools like bows, rifles, and traps, and they must follow specific regulations to ensure safety and conservation. While hunting has been a way to gather food for centuries, it also brings debates about ethics and animal rights, as some people believe it should only be done when necessary. For many, hunting connects them to nature and teaches respect for wildlife. </p>
